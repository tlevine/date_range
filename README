In Python I can produce a range of numbers like this. ::

    range(1, 10)

``date_range`` produces a range of dates like this. ::

    date_range(datetime.date(1990, 3, 30), datetime.date.today())

Install from PyPI. ::

    pip install date_range

Run tests like so. ::

    pytest test.py

It currently supports only full dates, just as range only supports integers,
It would be cool to add support for producing datetimes spaced by something smaller,
like half-days; this would be akin to adding support for floats in range.
